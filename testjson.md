  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

### 2. Onboard User (POST `/:id/onboarding`)

```json

  "location": "New York",
  "desire": "Growth in career",
  "career": "Tech Lead"
}
```

### 3. Onboarding Questions (POST `/:id/onboardingQuestions`)
Replace `:id` with the user ID.
```json

  "q5": "What is your preferred work environment?",
  "q6": "What are your salary expectations?",
